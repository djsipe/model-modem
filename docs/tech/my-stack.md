# My Stack
I recently had the pleasure of installing the Big Sur beta, having it totally corrupt my system, and having to re-install the OS from scratch.  Through that process I boiled down the the base-level app ecosystem I use day to day and wanted to share it with you.


## Utilities

### [Paste][1]
![Paste Logo](/assets/logos/paste.png){: .logo }  Paste is a fantastic clipboard manager application that saves items you copy to your clipboard into a tray at the bottom of your screen.  It also provides a satisfying "click" sound when an item is copied to the clipboardâ€”a feature that is extremely helpful when copying MFA codes from your iPhone.

### [1Password][2]
![1Password](/assets/logos/1password.png){: .logo } Arguably the most important application you could have is some sort of password manager.  There are many different options out there.  I tried LastPass in the past but ultimately selected 1Password.  It has a deep integration with MacOS and iOS which helps keep things simple.

### [Bartender][3]
![Bartender](/assets/logos/bartender.png){: .logo } The number of apps providing compact [menu bar apps][4] for MacOS greatly outpaces the amount of space that exists in the menu bar itself.  Bartender helps clear up space by allowing you to hide your less-used menu bar application.

!!! info "Pro Tip"
    You can rearrange your menubar applications natively (with no app needed) by holding down `^ Ctrl` and then clicking and dragging the menubar app.
